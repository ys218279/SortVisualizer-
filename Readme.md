2. Click the **Sort** button to begin sorting.  
3. View the sorted array updates after each step.  

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML** – Structure of the web page  
- **CSS** – Basic styling
- **JavaScript** – Implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm  

## Future Improvements  
- Add animations for better visualization
- Shows every sort step without having to click sort automatically
